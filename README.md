API demo for API's that abstract an organization (a company, social clubs, government entity, etc). 
It defines the membership structure with members and those underneath them. 
It defines the subdivisions, branches, etc. the are in the form Sub-organizations. I plan to add to it over time.
The main point of this is to demonstrate API'S.

As of 2/15/2026:
Organization GET and GET/id endpoints are now working. 
I plan on adding the POST, DELETE, and PUT functionality. 
The GET endpoints support pagination.
There is a database with fake data.
